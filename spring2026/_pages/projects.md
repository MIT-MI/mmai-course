title: Examples of Previous Project Reports
description: Project reports from student teams who participated in the MMAI course
---

We list here only project reports that were publicly released by students. It should be noted that some of these links are for the follow-up submissions to conferences, after some revisions of the original project reports.

If you previously took the MMAI course and ended up releasing a public version of your project, we would love to hear about it! Please contact the course instructor to be added to this list.
